# UoM Year 3 Individual Project

## A Project by Geping Wang

This is a repository for UoM Year 3 Individual Project where you can find files for MATLAB and Simulink simulation.

For running the model, please download `constants.m`, `GridTiedInverterNew.slx`, and `S_target_0.mat`.

For detailed explanation for the usage of each file, please refer to the table below.

| File                      | Description   |
| :------:                  | :-------      |
| `GridTiedInverterNew.slx` | Main model for the simulation.    |
| `Readme.md`               | This defines the text you are reading right now. (˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶)    |
| `S_target_0.mat`          | Test scenario which include the target profile of active and reactive power.  |
| `analysis.m`              | Calculation of response time, steady-state error and total harmonic distortion based on the simulation results.   |
| `constants.m`             | Stores all the parameters for the simulation. |
| `graphing.m`              | Plot graphs of power against time and current against time based on the simulation results.   |
| `total_harmonic_distortion.m`         | Plot graphs of harmonics based on the simulation results. |

Acknowledgement: Part of the code for data analysis and graph plotting involved the use of generative AI tools including ChatGPT and Deepseek.
